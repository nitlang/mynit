# Offers two APIs to manipulate read Json strings.
#
# The `dynamic` module provides a simple interface to get information
# from a Json document. You must be careful as all services are provided on
# each nodes and a wrongful use can `abort`.
#
# The `static` module converts a Json string to a nullable Nit object. The object
# must then be type checked before it can be used.
