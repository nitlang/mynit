An unofficial mailing list and other tools to keep faithful bargoers informed of the beers available at the excellent Brasserie Bénélux.

This project is composed of two softwares:

* a Web interface to subscribe and unsubscribe,
* and a daily background program which updates the BD and send emails.

The web interface is currently published at <http://benitlux.xymus.net/>

# Compile and execute

Make sure all the required packages are installed. Under Debian or Ubuntu, you can use: `apt-get install libevent-dev libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev sendmail`

To compile, run: `make`

To launch the daily background program, run: `bin/benitlux_daily` (the argument `-e` activates sending emails)

To launch the Web interface, run: `bin/benitlux_web`

The Web interface will be accessible at <http://localhost:8080/>
