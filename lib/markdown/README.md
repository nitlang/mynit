A markdown parser for Nit.

Markdown documentation can be found in http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/.
This parser is inspired by the famous TxtMark for Java (https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark).

## Usage

`nitmd` can be used as a standalone tool:

	$ nitmd file.md

Or you can use it programmatically by importing the `markdown` module.

## Differences with Markdown specification

This parser passes all tests inside http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/MarkdownTest_1.0_2007-05-09.tgz execpt of two:

1. Images.text: fails because this parser doesn't produce empty 'title' image attributes.
2. Literal quotes in titles.text: because markdown accepts unescaped quotes in titles and this is wrong.

## Testing

The NitUnit test suite can be found in `test_markdown.nit`.

Minimalists tests are prefixed with `process_*`. All tests from daringfireball are prefixed with `process_daring*`.

Run the test suite:

	$ nitunit lib/markdown/markdown.nit -t lib/markdown/test_markdown.nit
