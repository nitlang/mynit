# Core implementation of `app.nit` on Android using a custom Java entry point
#
# This module is implemented in 3 languages:
#
# * The Java code, in `NitActivity.java` acts as the entry point registered
#   to the Android OS. It relays most of the Android callbacks to C.
#   In theory, there may be more than one instance of `NitActivity` alive at
#   a given time. They hold a reference to the corresponding Nit `Activity`
#   in the attribute `nitActivity`.
#
# * The C code is defined in the top part of this source file. It acts as a
#   glue between Java and Nit by relaying calls between both languages.
#   It keeps a global variables reference to the Java VM and the Nit `App`.
#
# * The Nit code defines the `Activity` class with the callbacks from Android.
#   The callback methods should be redefined by user modules.
#
# The main is invoked when the native library is dynamically linked by
# the Java virtual machine. For this reason, the main _must_ execute quickly,
# on the main UI thread at least.
