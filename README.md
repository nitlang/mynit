Nit is an expressive language with a script-like syntax, a friendly type-system and aims at elegance, simplicity and intuitiveness.

Nit has a simple straightforward style and can usually be picked up quickly, particularly by anyone who has programmed before.
While object-oriented, it allows procedural styles.

The Nit Compiler (nitc) produces efficient machine language binaries.

Some Nit features:

 * Pure Object-Oriented.
 * Multiple Inheritance.
 * Realist typing policy.
 * Light and clear syntax.


Requirements:

 * gcc		http://gcc.gnu.org/ (or a compatible C compiler)
 * pkg-config	http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/
 * ccache	http://ccache.samba.org/	to improve recompilation
 * libgc-dev	http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/
 * graphviz	http://www.graphviz.org/	to enable graphs with the nitdoc tool
 * libunwind	http://nongnu.org/libunwind

Those are available in most Linux distributions

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential ccache libgc-dev graphviz libunwind-dev pkg-config

How to start:

    $ make
    $ bin/nitc examples/hello_world.nit
    $ ./hello_world

You can source `misc/nit_env.sh` to setup your environment like PATH, MANPATH and bash completion.
To have your environment automatically configured at login, just source it with `install` as argument.

    $ . misc/nit_env.sh install
