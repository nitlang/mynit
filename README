Nit is a statically typed object-oriented programming language.
The goal of Nit is to propose a statically typed programming language where structure is not a pain.

Nit has a simple straightforward style and can usually be picked up quickly, particularly by anyone who has programmed before.
While object-oriented, it allows procedural styles.

The Nit Compiler (nitc) produces efficient machine language binaries.

Some Nit features:

 * Pure Object-Oriented.
 * Multiple Inheritance.
 * Realist typing policy.
 * Light and clear syntax.


Requirement:

	* gcc		http://gcc.gnu.org/
	* ccache	http://ccache.samba.org/	to improve recompilation
	* libgc-dev	http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/
	* graphviz	http://www.graphviz.org/	to enable graphes with the nitdoc tool
	* libunwind	http://nongnu.org/libunwind
	* gperf		http://gnu.org/software/gperf	to enable mapping from C to Nit function names in a stack trace

Those are available in most linux distributions

    # sudo apt-get install build-essential ccache libgc-dev graphviz libunwind gperf
