# App audio abstraction
# Default behaviour is loading the audio from the `assets` folder of the project with its name and extension
# Platforms implementations can modify this comportement
#
# Once the application has started (after `App.setup`)
# use `App.load_sound` to get a sound
# then `Sound.play` to play it
