-> CONTENT
	- folder: nit-src: this folder contains the nit source file for the interpreter pnacl module,
		if you recompile it, you need to replace the 'pnacl_nit.pexe' file in 'public/pnacl'
		by the one you just regenerated.
	
	- folder: node_modules: this folder contains the modules required by Node.js to run the application.
	
	- folder: public: this folder contains all the elements required by the web application:
			- css folder for css files,
			- JS folder for JS files,
			- pnacl folder for pnacl files,
			- src folder for the Ace files required for the editor,

	- file: package.json: a file that describes the application for Node.js.
	
	- file: server.js: the file that sets up the server for the application.

-> GETTING STARTED
	- Run the application with:
		-> node server.js
		
	This will host the application at 'http://localhost:8080/'.
	
	NOTE: The application only works in Google Chrome or Chromium,
	its better to open the Chrome console while using the application (to see what's going on),
	the application is ready when the terminal appears in the page and when the message:
	'Nit library loaded (... files), ready to go.' is diplayed in the console.
