# Hello world

Minimal example using the standard Nit hello world program. The Nit code will be evaluated and executed once as soon as it is loaded. Standard output is redirected to the `console` element.

# Fibonacci

The Nit program is executed only when an input is supplied. The input is passed as the main arguments.

This is not ideal, the whole Nit program is executed at each call.
