# Provides basic game logic utilities using buckets to coordinate and
# optimize actions on game turn ends. Supports both action at each
# end of turn as well as actions on some end of turns.
#
# Allows for fast support of a large number of entities with rare actions,
# such as a forest with many individual trees.
