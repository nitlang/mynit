Hello world !
Usage of Strings:

Allocations, by type:
		
	-FlatString = 32
	-FlatBuffer = 2
	-Concat = 0
	-RopeBuffer = 0

Calls to length, by type:
	FlatString = 36 (cache misses 8, 22.22%)
	FlatBuffer = 4
Indexed accesses, by type:
	FlatString = 17
Calls to bytelen for each type:
	FlatString = 70
Calls to position for each type:
	FlatString = 35
Calls to bytepos for each type:
	FlatString = 18
Calls to first_byte on FlatString 153
Calls to last_byte on FlatString 103
FlatStrings allocated with length 82 (86.458%)
Length of travel for index distribution:
* 0 = 20 => occurences 83.333%, cumulative 83.333% 
* 1 = 8 => occurences 21.053%, cumulative 73.684%
