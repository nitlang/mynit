# Examples using the MPI protocol

As of now a single example is available at `src/mpi_simple.nit`.

# Setting up the cluster

* Install your distribution packages for OpenMPI, on Debian systems: `apt-get install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev`
* Prepare the other nodes of the cluster by installing at least `openmpi-bin`.
* List all the nodes in a file `hosts`, see `hosts.example`.

# Compiling and running the examples

* Compile the binary using `make`.
* Copy the binary on each node of the cluster (or recompile it there).
* Run with `make run`.
