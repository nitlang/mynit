# Libraries to manipulate JSON strings.
#
# Both `dynamic` and `static` modules provide at least a method to parse a
# value written in JSON, but only `static` provide a method to translate a
# value into JSON.
#
# The `dynamic` module provides a simple interface to get information
# from a JSON document. You must be careful as all services are provided on
# each nodes and a wrongful use can `abort`.
#
# The `static` module provides a common interface for anything that can be
# translated into a JSON document. The provided parsing method return a
# nullable Nit object that must then be type-checked before it can be used.
